Student Task: Add Permissions and a Custom Action to a ViewSet
Use an existing ViewSet (e.g., ArticleViewSet).

Create a custom permission (IsAuthor) that only allows the author of an article to update or delete it.

Apply the custom permission to your ViewSet (e.g., ArticleViewSet).

Add an extra action e.g., to the ArticleViewSet called publish (use @action) that updates a published field to True.
